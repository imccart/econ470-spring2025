Today we'll discuss demand estimation in the context of smoking. We'll also introduce the idea of instrumental variables as a way to estimate causal effects when confronted with selection on unobservables.

## Objectives
- Understand CDC and tax data sources
- Introduce the idea of instrumental variables

## Activities 
- Begin working with CDC Tax Burden data
- Derive initial instrumental variables estimate
- Define and explain the instrumental variable estimate as a ratio of a "reduced-form" to a "first-stage" estimate
