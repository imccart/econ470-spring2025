---


Today, we employ the IV estimator in the context of demand estimation for cigarettes. We also introduce the idea of a "fixed effect" in a regression specification.

## Objectives

- Understand and use an IV estimator in R
- Define and explain a fixed effect in a regression context
- Understand and describe the problem of weak instruments and how to test for weak instruments empirically


## Activities 

- Continue work with the [CDC Tax Burden on Tobacco](https://github.com/imccart/CDC-Tobacco) data
- Estimate the price elasticity of demand for cigarettes using taxes as an instrument for price
