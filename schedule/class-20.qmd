We'll begin implementing an RD with simulated data. We'll discuss the basics of the RD identification strategy, its implementation, and some details including bin and bandwidth selection.

## Objectives

- Describe the intuition underlying the RD identification strategy
- Implement an RD strategy with simulated data
- Explain optimal bandwidth and bin width selection


## Activities 

- Clone the [Medicare Advantage](https://github.com/imccart/ma-class) repository (if you haven't already) and begin working with data
- Implement RD design with simulated data in R
