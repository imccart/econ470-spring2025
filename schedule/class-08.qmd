title: "Class 8: Selection on Observables"
---

This class begins our first attempt to estimate a causal treatment effect. We'll do so with a few approaches, all of which rely on the combination of a "selection on observables" or "conditional independence" assumption, along with a "common support" assumption.

## Objectives
- Understand and explain the differences between matching and re-weighting
- Explain the implicit weighting in OLS regression and how to avoid such weighting
- Calculate an ATE or ATT using regression, matching, and weighting

## Activities 
- Continue working with the [Hospital Cost Report Information System (HCRIS)](https://github.com/imccart/hcris-class) repository.
- Estimate treatment effects with simulated data, using matching, regression, and re-weighting. The code file for in-class simulated data is available [here](https://imccart.github.io/econ470-content/01-hospital-pricing/in-class-code.R)
