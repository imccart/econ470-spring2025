## For next class

I'll use `R` for this class, and I'll use `Visual Studio Code` as my text editor. I'll also use `Git` for version control. If you're not familiar with these tools, don't worry. We'll go over them in class. For next class, please do the following:

1. Download [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
2. Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
4. Download [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) if you want to use it
5. Create a account on [GitHub](https://github.com/)
