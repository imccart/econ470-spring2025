title: "Class 12: Smoking and Demand Elasticity"
---

The goal of this module is to understand instrumental variables as a causal identification strategy. We'll do this in the context of smoking and cigarette prices. Effectively, we want to estimate a demand curve for cigarettes, accounting for the fact that movements in quantity and price derive from changes in both supply and demand.
