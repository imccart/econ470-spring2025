Each area of the course will be covered by way of an example research question, which you can use to guide your own projects throughout the semester. By the end of this course, you will be able to:\n\nOrganize project files using Git and GitHub\nClean and manage several datasets using tidy data in RStudio\nSummarize and visualize data with RStudio and the ggplot2 package\nImplement selected methods for causal inference using real data\nExplain research results with a written report and discussion"

    "text": "Course materials\n\nWhere to go\nThe best place for information on the class is our class website, here. I use the website as an easier way for you to access course materials, including notes/slides, a detailed schedule, and assignments. I’ll also use Canvas to distribute any papers or specific readings that aren’t available publicly, as well as post information that I don’t want public like virtual meeting passwords (if necessary) and grades.\n\n\nReadings\nThere is no required textbook for this class, but there are several books that I recommend for additional information and examples. The first is not free but is still very good:\n\nAngrist and Pischke (2009)\n\nThe following are also excellent resources, with the added bonus of having freely available versions of these texts online. Here are links to the free online versions:\n\nR for Data Science\nCausal Inference: The Mixtape\nThe Effect: An Introduction to Research Design and Causality\n\n\n\nStatistics software\nI’ll use R for my work and in all my answer keys and examples. I encourage you to use R as well, since that will be the language for which I can help you the most with any questions. That said, if you can answer all of the questions correctly with another software, feel free to do so. I am well-versed in Stata but less so in Python. If you choose to use Python (not a bad choice given its popularity), then I can certainly help with general questions and concepts, but I will be less helpful with any syntax issues.\n\n\nAccessing data\nFor all assignments and in-class activities, the necessary raw data will be available in our class OneDrive folder. For transparency, I will also point you to other GitHub repositories where available. We’ll spend some time on Git and GitHub at the beginning of the class, so don’t get too worried if this is new to you. If you’re new to Git or GitHub and want to understand some of that better, take a look at Grant McDermott’s notes on Data Science for Economists as well as Jenny Bryan’s online reference book, Happy Git and GitHub with R.\n\n\nLogistics\nFor day-to-day communication and announcements, I’ll use Canvas. Please be sure you’ve set up Canvas alerts so that you see all of these announcements in a timely manner."

    "text": "Course policies\nBe nice. Be honest. Don’t cheat.\nVarious policies for this course are described below. Basically, let’s all work to be good citizens and take seriously our various roles as a student, teacher, friend, colleague, human, etc.\n\nClass meetings\nAll regular class meetings will take place in White Hall, 200 on Mondays and Wednesdays from 8:30am to 9:45am.\n\n\nOffice hours\nMy designated office hours will be on Monday and Wednesday from 10:00am to 11:30am in R. Rollins, R418. I’m also available outside of these times. I just ask that you schedule an appointment in advance. Make an appointment with me here.\nWhile we call these “office hours” they really should be “student hours”. These are set times dedicated to all of you. This means that I will be in my office waiting for you to come by with whatever questions you have. Take a look at this video for a more interesting presentation of what office hours really are and why you should come!\n\n\nFor any questions that you don’t think need a meeting, you can always reach out to me through email. I do my best to respond within 24 hours to all emails.\n\n\nTurning things in\nAll assignments should be submitted as PDFs in GradeScope, along with a link to a GitHub repository.\n\n\nAcademic integrity\nThe Honor Code is in effect throughout the semester. By taking this course, you affirm that it is a violation of the code to cheat on exams, to plagiarize, to deviate from the teacher’s instructions about collaboration on work that is submitted for grades, to give false information to a faculty member, and to undertake any other form of academic misconduct. You agree that the instructor is entitled to move you to another seat during examinations, without explanation. You also affirm that if you witness others violating the code you have a duty to report them to the honor council. Students who violate the Honor Code may be subject to a written mark on their record, failure of the course, suspension, permanent dismissal, or a combination of these and other sanctions. The Honor Code may be reviewed here.\n\n\nChatGPT\nIn this course, students are encouraged to leverage the capabilities of ChatGPT and related AI software for academic exploration and assistance. However, it is essential to uphold the principles of academic integrity. While you are free to seek guidance from ChatGPT, the final submissions of all assignments and assessments must reflect your individual understanding and expression. Any instance of verbatim or substantially unaltered content from ChatGPT or other external sources (including your own classmates) will be considered plagiarism and subject to our policies on academic integrity (see above). The goal is to foster critical thinking and creativity while utilizing the tool responsibly. If you have any questions about the appropriate use of ChatGPT or related software, please ask me.\n\n\nAccessibility services\nIf you anticipate issues related to the format or requirements of this course, please meet with me. I would like us to discuss ways to ensure your full participation in the course. If you determine that accommodations are necessary, you may register with Accessibility Services at (404)727-9877 or via e-mail at accessibility@emory.edu. To register with OAS, students must self identify and initiate contact with the OAS office.\n\n\nAbsence policy\nMissing 25% or more of class meetings will result in automatic failure of a course. In other words, students absent seven (7) or more times, in a course that meets twice a week, will receive a grade of “F” for the course. Absences include trips, appointments, interviews, conferences, illness, injury, as well as simply not showing up. Religious observances, school business, and major illness will be considered; however, notify me in advance of any planned absences and submit your assignment prior to the event. After any absence, it is your responsibility to find out what material, assignments, or announcements you missed.\n\n\nLauren’s Promise\nI will listen and believe you if someone is threatening you.\nLauren McCluskey, a 21-year-old honors student athlete, was murdered on October 22, 2018 by a man she briefly dated on the University of Utah campus. We must all take action to ensure that this never happens again.\nIf you are in immediate danger, call 911 or Emory police (404-727-6111).\nAny form of sexual harassment or violence will not be excused or tolerated at Emory. If you are experiencing sexual assault, domestic violence, or stalking, please report it to me or directly to Emory’s Office of Respect (470-270-5360)."

To do this, we will spend significant in-class time reviewing the assignments and updating our work based on collective feedback. For each assignment, students will be placed into small groups to discuss each others’ work. Your participation grade will derive from a peer evaluation based on these small group sessions.\nAt the end of each assignment, each member of each group will be asked to rate the feedback of their peers on a scale of 1-3. A value of 1 reflects insufficient effort or engagement, a value of 2 reflects sufficient effort, and a value of 3 reflects excellent effort. I anticipate small groups of 3-4 students. Your median score across all peer evaluations will be used as your participation grade in that assignment. For example, if you receive peer scores of 3, 3, and 1, your participation score would be 3. If the median value is a tie, your participation grade will be the highest of the possible values.\nAt the end of the semester, your peer participation grades from each assignment will be totaled. Your final participation grade will be based on your total number of participation points out of 10. Note there are 15 possible participation points, so there is some margin for error here if you happen to miss class during a small group session or simply aren’t engaged in one of the review sessions for some reason.",

I will provide all answers in R; however, you are free to use any software you’d like. Just keep in mind that I will be best able to answer your questions if you also use R. I can also answer most any question if you choose to use Stata. I can point you in the right direction with Python, but I likely can’t provide you with any sample code or specific syntax advice.\nPlease submit all of your homework answers as a PDF via GradeScope (accessed from Canvas). Your PDF must also include a hyperlink to a GitHub repository with all of your code files. If you keep the repository private, please be sure to share the repository with me using my ian.mccarthy@emory.edu email address. I strongly encourage you to use RMarkdown, Quarto, or Jupyter Notebooks, which will help you to easily create PDFs and is much better for writing data-oriented documents. If you are not familiar with these tools, take a look at the following resources:\n\nR Markdown: The Definitive Guide\nUsing R Markdown for Class Reports\nIntroduction to Quarto\nQuarto in R for Data Science\nIntroduction to Jupyter Notebooks\n\nIf you’re new to these tools, then there will be some growing pains. Please be patient with yourself and stick to it. One of the goals of the course is to develop good workflow habits. This means doing work in a way that minimizes mistakes and maximizes reproducibility. These tools exist exactly for these reasons. It allows you to keep your data analysis and the description of that analysis together in a single document or group of documents. It’s really easy to introduce mistakes when copying and pasting empirical results into a text document, and it’s even easier to waste hours (days/weeks?) re-pasting results into your text document and re-writing the results accordingly. Doing everything in R Markdown, Quarto, or Jupyter Notebooks avoids all of these issues. In the long run, it’s much more efficient.\nNote that, for your submission, I do not need to see all of your code. Your PDF should be a finalized, clean, visually engaging summary of your work. The code belongs in the GitHub repository.\nHomeworks 2-5 are worth 30 points each toward your final grade (15% each) and consists of 10 individual questions. Each question is worth 3 points, graded as follows:\n\n1 point for an attempted answer as of the initial due date\n1 point for a nearly-correct answer as of the revision date\n1 point for a correct final answer as of the final due date\n\nDue to the staged structure of each assignment, you should submit three PDFs for each assignment, and your repository should similarly be organized with three subfolders for each submission. To make it easy to navigate everyone’s repositories, we need everyone to adopt the same directory structure and naming convention. Please be sure to name your solution documents as follows: lastname-firstinitial-hwk(num)-(submission num). For example, if I’m finalizing the initial submission for homework 1, then the file should be named mccarthy-i-hwk1-1.pdf. A complete directory structure is provided below. Please adopt this structure as it will also help you to keep your analysis and data organized. Finally, please note that you should not include the “data” folder in git or github. The data files are too big and should never be tracked in that way. Instead, please be sure to add the data folder to your gitignore file.\nhomework2\n|   README.md\n|\n|---data (not tracked in git or pushed to github)\n|   |   input (symbolic links)\n|   |   output (analytic data sets)\n|\n|---submission1\n|   |---data-code\n|   |---analysis\n|   |---results\n|   |   mccarthy-i-hwk2-1.pdf\n|\n|---submission2\n|   |---data-code\n|   |---analysis\n|   |---results\n|   |   mccarthy-i-hwk2-2.pdf\n|\n|---submission3\n|   |---data-code\n|   |---analysis\n|   |---results\n|   |   mccarthy-i-hwk2-3.pdf\n|\nHomework 1 is more of a foundational assignment, designed to get us all up and running with VS Code, Git, GitHub, and some initial data summaries.

Code to do this is in the class slides.\n\nCalculate the average price among penalized versus non-penalized hospitals.\nSplit hospitals into quartiles based on bed size. To do this, create 4 new indicator variables, where each variable is set to 1 if the hospital’s bed size falls into the relevant quartile. Provide a table of the average price among treated/control groups for each quartile.\nFind the average treatment effect using each of the following estimators, and present your results in a single table:\n\nNearest neighbor matching (1-to-1) with inverse variance distance based on quartiles of bed size\nNearest neighbor matching (1-to-1) with Mahalanobis distance based on quartiles of bed size\nInverse propensity weighting, where the propensity scores are based on quartiles of bed size\nSimple linear regression, adjusting for quartiles of bed size using dummy variables and appropriate interactions as discussed in class\n\nWith these different treatment effect estimators, are the results similar, identical, very different?\nDo you think you’ve estimated a causal effect of the penalty? Why or why not? (just a couple of sentences)\nBriefly describe your experience working with these data (just a few sentences). Tell me one thing you learned and one thing that really aggravated or surprised you."
